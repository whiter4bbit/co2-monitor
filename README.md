# co2-monitor

Monitor that can be started on RPI. It periodically reads measurements from the [device](http://www.wetterladen.de/aircontrol-co2-monitor-mini-tfa-31.5006) and sends results to the provided URL in the json format:

```
POST /series/t
Authorization: Bearer token

{
    "entries": [
        {
            "timestamp": 1619976247642,
            "value": 81.0
        },
        {
            "timestamp": 1619976266312,
            "value": 84.0
        }
    ]
}
```

The project was inspired by the [Reverse-Engineering a low-cost USB CO₂ monitor](https://hackaday.io/project/5301-reverse-engineering-a-low-cost-usb-co-monitor) project.
